        <p class="description">
          At 6:30 p.m. on November 7, Royal, Ayan, Aslan, and Nuray gathered all the neighborhood children and began the event.
          First, we set up computers and an internet connection, arranged a projector, and turned off the lights to create a focused atmosphere. 
          Once everything was checked, Nuray introduced our team and explained our purpose. Ayan then presented slides about ADA while Royal recorded, and Aslan took photos of the presentation.
          Next, we opened the classic maze puzzle project from the Hour of Code event on the board. The children watched an introductory video, and Royal gave a brief explanation of the task. 
          They eagerly began the exercises.
          Ayan and Nuray assisted with any technical issues, while Aslan and Royal offered tips to help the children complete each step more easily. 
          Once everyone finished, Aslan asked for each child’s name, and Nuray wrote them on certificates.
          Finally, we handed out the certificates, and Aslan captured a photo of the children proudly holding them.
          The entire process took about an hour, and the event was a memorable experience for everyone involved.

        <p class="description">
          As we were able to arrive at the course, we conducted our teaching
          sessions on time and had enough interactions with participants. All
          team members reported on time, and knowing their roles helped to avoid
          any difficult situations. Proper explanations were provided during the
          course, improving understanding and maintaining the audience’s
          interest. There was also adequate internet coverage among all the
          participants, thus making it easy to incorporate relevant web-based
          resources and interactive elements into the learning experience.

        <h2 class="section-title">Main Challenges</h2>
        <p class="description">
          The first major challenge was that the projector didn’t work as
          expected. After some adjustments, we tried to focus the projection
          only on the board. However, this significantly reduced the quality, so
          we had to expand the display area. As a result, not all the children
          could see the subtitles on the board. To solve this, we asked them to
          open subtitles on their own devices to follow along with the video.
          Moreover, a few students had devices on low battery and therefore
          required some time to look for suitable chargers or other kinds of
          devices. This not only delayed the course longer than was necessary
          but also had an adverse effect on their attention spans.

        <h2 class="section-title">Preparation</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Our team planned everything from the very beginning. First, we invited
          neighborhood children to join us. Then, we started searching for a
          suitable place to teach them. Nuray asked her teacher, and we
          finalized the date and time. However, we didn't have a projector, so
          we began looking to rent one. Fortunately, we found one and managed to
          arrange it. When we arrived, we set up the computers, checked the
          internet connections, and arranged the projector to create an engaging
          environment. We prepared an introductory presentation to explain our
          purpose and selected an interactive maze puzzle from Code.org (<a
            href="https://studio.code.org/hoc/1"
            target="_blank"
            >https://studio.code.org/hoc/1</a
          >) to capture the children’s interest. We also printed certificates in
          advance, so each child would have something to commemorate their
          participation. These preparations helped us manage the event
          efficiently and make it enjoyable for everyone. <br /><br />
          During the event, we inquired about their prior experiences with
          coding, and they responded that some of them were students at the Step
          Academy course, while the others were students at Code Academy. As we
          organized the event, we observed the passion in their eyes and their
          contentment with the event. At the conclusion of the event, we sought
          their feedback; did they enjoy it or not? All of them responded
          affirmatively, which brought us great joy.
          <br /><br />
          In conclusion, this event was a memorable and enriching experience
          that contributed to the development of leadership, communication, and
          teaching skills. As Team 48, we were privileged to have the
          opportunity to organize the Hour of Code, under the guidance of
          professors, for children interested in learning about coding or
          pursuing their education at ADA University. The involvement of ADA
          students as mentors served as an inspiration for many of the young
          participants.

        <p class="description">
          First of all, we would like to thank each team member for their
          dedication and support. Ayan did a great job introducing ADA to the
          students with slides, while Aslan recorded videos, took photos, and
          provided explanations to keep the children engaged. Nuray helped
          gather the children and introduced us and our purpose. Royal also
          supported the students by assisting them with tasks and providing
          basic information about the coding process. Each team member was
          actively involved in helping students when they faced technical or
          coding issues. Finally, we would like to thank Cavid Asadov for
          providing us with a place to complete our project. The combined
          efforts of everyone ensured that we could overcome challenges and
          create a positive experience for the children.
